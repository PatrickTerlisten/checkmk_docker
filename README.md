# Dockerized CheckMK instance

This is a Docker Compose file for a CheckMK instance in Docker. It's a pretty simple setup. Make sure to adjust the `image` variable, which reflects the version of the CheckMK image. You also should adjust the environment variables for the mail relay and the CMK site itself (site name and password).
